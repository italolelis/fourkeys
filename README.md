# Four Keys

Through six years of research, the [DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA)](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/the-2019-accelerate-state-of-devops-elite-performance-productivity-and-scaling) team has identified four key metrics that indicate the performance of a software development team. Four Keys allows you to collect data from your development environment (such as GitHub or GitLab) and compiles it into a dashboard displaying these key metrics.

These four key metrics are:

*   **Deployment Frequency**
*   **Lead Time for Changes**
*   **Time to Restore Services**
*   **Change Failure Rate**

   <td>STRING

   <td>Encrypted signature key from the event. This will be the <strong>unique key</strong> for the table.

Where the key icon indicates that the ID is generated by the original system, such as GitHub.

## Color coding

The dashboard has color coding to show the performance of each metric. Green is strong performance, yellow is moderate performance, and red is poor performance. Below is the description of the data that corresponds to the color for each metric.

The data ranges used for this color coding roughly follows the ranges for elite, high, medium, and low performers that are described in the [2019 State of DevOps Report](https://www.devops-research.com/research.html#reports). 

**Deployment Frequency**

*   **Green:** Weekly
*   **Yellow:** Monthly
*   **Red:** Between once per month and once every six months.  
    *   This is expressed as ‚ÄúYearly.‚Äù 

**Lead Time to Change**

*   **Green:** Less than one week
*   **Yellow:** Between one week and one month
*   **Red:** Between one month and six months.  
*   **Red:** Anything greater than six months
    *   This is expressed as ‚ÄúOne year.‚Äù 

**Time to Restore Service**

*   **Green:** Less than one day
*   **Yellow:** Less than one week
*   **Red:**  Between one week and a month
    *   This is expressed as ‚ÄúOne month‚Äù 
*   **Red:** Anything greater than a month
    *   This is expressed as ‚ÄúOne year‚Äù 

**Change Failure Rate**

*   **Green:** Less than 15%
*   **Yellow:** 16% - 45%
*   **Red:**  Anything greater than 45%
